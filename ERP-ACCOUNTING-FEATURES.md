## Overview
This document provides a deep-dive summary of the ERP system's accounting features, focusing on the asset management, journal entries, and chart of accounts modules. It covers the code structure, business logic, validation, and user interface components.

---

## Project Structure
- **app/**: Business logic (Models, Controllers, Services, Traits, Domains)
- **resources/views/**: Blade templates for UI (assets, journal-entries, chart-of-accounts, etc.)
- **database/**: Migrations, seeders, factories
- **config/**: Configuration files (accounting, app, etc.)
- **public/**: Public assets (JS, CSS, images)
- **routes/**: Route definitions (web.php, api.php, etc.)

---

## Key Modules

### Asset Management
- **Models**: `Asset`, `AssetCategory`, `AssetTransaction`, `AssetDetail`, etc.
- **Controllers**: `AssetController`, `Asset/CategoryController`
- **Views**: `assets/index.blade.php`, `assets/create.blade.php`, `assets/edit.blade.php`, `assets/show.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Asset creation, editing, and listing
  - Depreciation calculation (Straight Line, Declining Balance, Sum of Years Digits, Units of Production)
  - Asset transactions (purchase, disposal, revaluation, maintenance)
  - Integration with Chart of Accounts and Journal Entries
  - Validation for useful life, purchase date, purchase price, and asset status

### Accounting & Journal Entries
- **Models**: `JournalEntry`, `JournalEntryItem`, `ChartOfAccount`
- **Controllers**: `JournalEntryController`, `ChartOfAccountController`
- **Views**: `journal-entries/`, `chart-of-accounts/`
- **Features**:
  - Double-entry bookkeeping
  - Validation: debits = credits, valid accounts, open periods
  - Posting, voiding, editing entries
  - Account balances, recent entries, and statistics
  - Service layer for validation and exports

### Chart of Accounts
- **Model**: `ChartOfAccount`
- **Controller**: `ChartOfAccountController`
- **Views**: `chart-of-accounts/`
- **Features**:
  - Account creation, editing, grouping, and classification
  - Account statistics (total debits, credits, current balance)
  - Hierarchical account structure

---

## Calculation & Validation Logic

### Depreciation Calculation
- **Location**: `Asset` model, `AssetController`, `AssetTransaction`
- **Methods**: Straight Line, Declining Balance, Sum of Years Digits, Units of Production
- **Validation**: Checks for useful life, purchase date, purchase price, and asset status
- **Logic Example**:
  ```php
  // Asset Model
  public function getDepreciationAmount() {
      // ... logic for each method ...
      // Straight Line: (cost - salvage) / useful_life
      // Declining Balance: current_value * rate
      // ...
  }
  ```

### Journal Entry Sums
- **Validation**: Ensures total debits = total credits (in controller, request, and JS)
- **Summing**: Uses Eloquent's `sum('debit')` and `sum('credit')` on `JournalEntryItem`
- **Posting**: Only allows posting if balanced
- **Logic Example**:
  ```php
  // JournalEntryController
  $totalDebit = collect($request->items)->sum('debit');
  $totalCredit = collect($request->items)->sum('credit');
  if (abs($totalDebit - $totalCredit) > 0.01) {
      throw new \Exception('Total debits must equal total credits.');
  }
  ```

---

## UI & User Experience
- **Blade Templates**: Consistent use of Tailwind CSS, responsive layouts, and notification components
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic validation, auto-balancing, and notifications (see `resources/js/journal-entry.js`)
- **Forms**: Validation both client-side and server-side
- **Features**:
  - Asset and journal entry forms with real-time validation
  - Notification popups for success/error
  - Pagination and search in index views

---

## Security & Error Handling
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms and AJAX requests use CSRF tokens
- **Validation**: Laravel validation in requests and controllers
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch in controllers, user-friendly error messages, logging

---

## Extensibility & Best Practices
- **Service Layer**: For validation and exports (e.g., `JournalEntryValidationService`)
- **Traits**: For reusable logic (e.g., `AssetCalculations`)
- **Soft Deletes**: Used in most models for data safety
- **Config Driven**: Account types, groups, and defaults are in config files

---

## Example: Asset Depreciation Calculation Flow
1. **User Action**: Clicks "Calculate Depreciation" on asset
2. **Controller**: Validates asset, calls model method
3. **Model**: Computes depreciation based on method and parameters
4. **Transaction**: Creates asset transaction and journal entry
5. **UI**: Shows notification and updates asset value

---

## Example: Journal Entry Creation Flow
1. **User Action**: Fills out journal entry form
2. **JS Validation**: Ensures debits = credits, valid accounts
3. **Controller**: Validates and saves entry, creates items
4. **Posting**: Only allowed if entry is balanced
5. **UI**: Shows entry in index, allows export and print
